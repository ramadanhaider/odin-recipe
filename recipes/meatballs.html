    <img src="https://www.flavcity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/meatballs-tomato-sauce.jpg">
    <p>Meatballs are a versatile and flavorful dish made by 
        combining ground meat, such as beef, pork, chicken, 
        turkey, or lamb, with various seasonings and binding 
        ingredients like breadcrumbs and eggs. These small, 
        round, savory morsels are typically seasoned with 
        herbs, spices, garlic, onion, and sometimes cheese,
        depending on regional and cultural variations. Meatballs
        can be cooked in several ways, including frying, baking,
        steaming, or simmering in sauces like marinara, gravy, 
        or curry. They are a popular component in global cuisines, 
        from Italian spaghetti and meatballs to Swedish köttbullar 
        and Middle Eastern kofta, making them a universally beloved 
        comfort food.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground meat: 1 lb (beef, pork, chicken, turkey, or a mix)</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs: 1/2 cup</li>
        <li>Egg: 1 large</li>
        <li>Milk: 2 tbsp (optional, for tenderness)</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese: 1/4 cup (optional, for flavor)</li>
        <li>Garlic: 2 cloves, minced</li>
        <li>Onion: 1 small, finely chopped or grated</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley: 2 tbsp, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper: To taste</li>
        <li>Dried oregano or Italian seasoning: 1 tsp (optional)</li>
        <li>Olive oil or vegetable oil: For frying (if pan-frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Prepare the mixture:</h3></li>
        <p>In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, breadcrumbs, egg, milk, Parmesan cheese, garlic, onion, parsley, salt, pepper, and seasonings. Mix gently with your hands or a spoon until just combined. Avoid overmixing, as this can make the meatballs tough.</p>
        <li><h3>Form the meatballs:</h3></li>
        <p>Using your hands, shape the mixture into balls about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. You can use a small ice cream scoop for even sizing. Place them on a baking sheet or plate.</p>
        <li><h3>Cook the meatballs:</h3></li>
        <p><h4>Pan-frying:</h4> Heat a skillet over medium heat and add a thin layer of oil. Cook the meatballs in batches, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides and cooked through (about 10 minutes).
            <br><h4>Baking:</h4> Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Arrange the meatballs on a lined baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes, or until browned and cooked through.
            <br><h4>Simmering in sauce:</h4> Brown the meatballs briefly in a pan or oven, then simmer them in marinara sauce for 20 minutes to infuse flavor and ensure thorough cooking.</p>
        <li><h3>Serve:</h3></li>
        <p>Enjoy the meatballs on their own, over pasta, in a sandwich, or as part of another dish like soup or curry. </p>
