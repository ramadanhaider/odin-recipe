    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering flat pasta sheets with rich fillings such as seasoned meat, vegetables, creamy ricotta or béchamel sauce, and melted cheese, all topped with a savory tomato or meat-based sauce. This hearty, baked casserole is known for its distinct layers of flavor and texture, which come together to create a comforting and satisfying meal. Variations of lasagna can include ingredients like spinach, mushrooms, or seafood, making it a versatile dish that can be tailored to different tastes and dietary preferences. Often served as a main course, lasagna is a favorite for family dinners and festive gatherings.</p>

    </ul>
    <h3>For cheese mixture:</h3>

        <li>Ricotta cheese: 15 oz</li>
        <li>Egg: 1 large</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese: 1/2 cup, grated</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley: 2 tbsp, chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Other ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles: 12 sheets (cooked or no-boil)</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese: 2 cups, shredded</li>
        <li>Olive oil: 1 tbsp (optional, for cooking the sauce)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or pot over medium heat. Add the ground beef or sausage, breaking it into small pieces as it cooks. Once browned, drain any excess fat.
            Add the onion and garlic to the meat, cooking until softened.
            Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce on low heat for 20–30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan cheese, and parsley (if using). Mix until smooth and set aside.</li>    
        <li>If using regular lasagna noodles, cook them in boiling salted water according to package instructions. Drain and lay them flat on a baking sheet or parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
            In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom to prevent sticking.
            Place a layer of noodles over the sauce, overlapping slightly.
            Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce. Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese.
            Repeat the layers (noodles, ricotta, meat sauce, mozzarella) until the dish is full, ending with a final layer of meat sauce and mozzarella on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil (to prevent the cheese from burning) and bake for 25 minutes.
            Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15–20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for 10–15 minutes after baking to make it easier to slice. Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
