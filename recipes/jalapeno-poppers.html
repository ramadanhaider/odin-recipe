    <img src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/EoIF0_pihDv4ehNrOq28zuit-4k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/233603-bacon-wrapped-jalepeno-poppers-DDMFS-4x3-1263-d3ef49b414144e05a3bc045b4c30b276.jpg">
    <p>Jalapeño poppers are a popular appetizer made by stuffing halved or whole jalapeño peppers with a creamy and flavorful filling, typically consisting of cream cheese, cheddar cheese, and seasonings. The stuffed peppers are then coated in breadcrumbs or batter and fried or baked until golden and crispy. Some variations include wrapping the peppers in bacon for added smokiness or incorporating additional ingredients like sausage or spices into the filling. Known for their perfect balance of heat, creaminess, and crunch, jalapeño poppers are a favorite snack at parties, game nights, and casual gatherings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Jalapeño peppers: 10–12 medium-sized</li>
        <li>Cream cheese: 8 oz (softened)</li>
        <li>Cheddar cheese: 1 cup, shredded</li>
        <li>Garlic powder: 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Paprika or smoked paprika: 1 tsp (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper: To taste</li>
        <li>Bacon slices: 10–12 (optional, for wrapping)</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs: 1 cup (for coating, optional)</li>
        <li>Eggs: 2 (for dipping, optional)</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour: 1/2 cup (for dredging, optional)</li>
        <li>Oil: For frying (if frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the peppers thoroughly.
            Slice each jalapeño in half lengthwise and remove the seeds and membranes using a small spoon or knife (leave some seeds if you prefer extra heat).</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, shredded cheddar cheese, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Spoon the cheese mixture into each jalapeño half, smoothing the top so the filling is even. Set aside.</li>
        <li>For a crispy coating, prepare a dredging station with three shallow bowls:
            Bowl 1: Flour
            Bowl 2: Beaten eggs
            Bowl 3: Breadcrumbs
            Dip each stuffed jalapeño into the flour, then the egg, and finally coat it with breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>If desired, wrap each stuffed jalapeño half with a slice of bacon, securing it with a toothpick.</li>
        <li>Baking: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Arrange the poppers on a lined baking sheet and bake for 20–25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and the peppers are tender. If using bacon, bake until crispy.
            Frying: Heat oil in a deep pan to 350°F (175°C). Carefully fry the poppers in batches until golden brown (about 2–3 minutes). Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
            Air-frying: Preheat your air fryer to 375°F (190°C). Cook the poppers in a single layer for 10–12 minutes, checking for doneness.</li>
        <li>Allow the jalapeño poppers to cool slightly before serving. They pair well with dipping sauces like ranch, sour cream, or chipotle mayo.</li>

    </ol>
